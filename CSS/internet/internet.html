                <ul>

                    <li><span class = "blue">Servers</span> are computers that store <span class = "blue">webpages</span>, <span class = "blue">sites</span>, or <span class="blue">apps</span>.

                <ol>
                    <li>The browser goes to the <span class="blue">DNS server</span> amd finds the real address of the <span class="blue">server</span> that the website lives on.</li>
                    <li> The browser sends an <span class="blue">HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client</li>
                    <li> If the server approves the client's request. the server sends the client a <span class = "blue">"200 OK" message</span>, which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks.</li>
                    <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you!</li>
